!   This test  produces the b-spline coeff.s  bcoef  of the spline of order
!   k  with knots  t(i), i=1,..., n + k , which takes on the value
!   gtau(i) at  tau(i), i=1,..., n .
!
!******  Given data  ******
!  tau.....array of length  n , containing data point abscissae.
!    a s s u m p t i o n . . .  tau  is strictly increasing
!  gtau.....corresponding array of length  n , containing data point or-
!        dinates
!  t.....knot sequence, of length  n+k
!  n.....number of data points and dimension of spline space  s(k,t)
!  k.....order of spline
!
!******  Computed  ******
!  q.....array of size  (2*k-1)*n , containing the triangular factoriz-
!        ation of the coefficient matrix of the linear system for the b-
!        coefficients of the spline interpolant.
!           the b-coeffs for the interpolant of an additional data set
!        (tau(i),htau(i)), i=1,...,n  with the same data abscissae can
!        be obtained without going through all the calculations in this
!        routine, simply by loading  htau  into  bcoef  and then execut-
!        ing the    call banslv ( q, 2*k-1, n, k-1, k-1, bcoef )
!  bcoef.....the b-coefficients of the interpolant, of length  n
!  iflag.....an integer indicating success (= 1)  or failure (= 2)
!        the linear system to be solved is (theoretically) invertible if
!        and only if
!              t(i) .lt. tau(i) .lt. t(i+k),    all i.
!        violation of this condition is certain to lead to  iflag = 2 .
!
!******  m e t h o d  ******
!     the i-th equation of the linear system  a*bcoef = b  for the b-co-
!  effs of the interpolant enforces interpolation at  tau(i), i=1,...,n.
!  hence,  b(i) = gtau(i), all i, and  a  is a band matrix with  2k-1
!   bands (if it is invertible).
!     the matrix  a  is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by di-
!  agonal, in the  r o w s  of the array  q , with the main diagonal go-
!  ing into row  k .  see comments in the program below.
!     the banded system is then solved by a call to  banfac (which con-
!  structs the triangular factorization for  a  and stores it again in
!   q ), followed by a call to  banslv (which then obtains the solution
!   bcoef  by substitution).
!     banfac  does no pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix
!  a  makes this unnecessary.
