C
C                        W

c                          that must be declared by the user.  The first
c                          two declarative statements in the user program
c                          calling SEPELI must be:
c
c                               USE fish
c                               TYPE (fishworkspace) :: W
c
c                          The first statement makes the fishpack module
c                          defined in the file "fish.f" available to the
c                          user program calling HWSCSP.  The second statement
c                          declares a derived type variable (defined in
c                          the module "fish.f") which is used internally
c                          in HWSCSP to dynamically allocate real and complex
c                          work space used in solution.  An error flag
c                          (IERROR = 20) is set if the required work space
c                          allocation fails (for example if N,M are too large)
c                          Real and complex values are set in the components
c                          of W on a initial (INTL=0) call to HWSCSP.  These
c                          must be preserved on non-initial calls (INTL=1)
c                          to HWSCSP.  This eliminates redundant calculations
c                          and saves compute time.
c               ****       IMPORTANT!  The user program calling HWSCSP should
c                          include the statement:
c
c                               CALL FISHFIN(W)
C
C                          after the final approximation is generated by
C                          HWSCSP.  The will deallocate the real and complex
c                          work space of W.  Failure to include this statement
c                          could result in serious memory leakage.
