	Abstract = {Along with text and graphics, images are fast becoming a generic data
	type for general-purpose computer systems. This poses new problems
	for the systems designer, who must be able to preprocess digital
	image data for a wide variety of video and hard copy displays. Digital
	halftoning, the method by which the illusion of continuous-tone images
	are created through the arrangement of binary picture elements, is
	a key component of any preprocessing. Digital Halftoning addresses
	the problem of developing algorithms that best match the specific
	parameters of any target display device. It is the first significant
	study of the process of producing quality images on practical computer
	displays. To aid the systems designer, Ulichney devises the concept
	of blue noise - which has many desirable properties for halftoning
	- and suggests efficient algorithms for its use. He also introduces
	new metrics for analyzing the frequency content of periodic and aperiodic
	patterns for both rectangular and hexagonal grids, and presents a
	unique aspect ratio immunity argument in favor of hexagonal grids.
	Included are several carefully selected digitally-produced images.},
