  abstract = {A new scheme for solving the Vlasov equation using an unstructured
	mesh for the phase space is proposed. The algorithm is based on the
	semi-Lagrangian method which exploits the fact that the distribution
	function is constant along the characteristic curves. We use different
	local interpolation operators to reconstruct the distribution function
	f, some of which need the knowledge of the gradient of f. We can
	use limiter coefficients to maintain the positivity and the L∞ bound
	of f and optimize these coefficients to ensure the conservation of
	the \{L1\} norm, that is to say the mass by solving a linear programming
	problem. Several numerical results are presented in two and three
	(axisymmetric case) dimensional phase space. The local interpolation
	technique is well suited for parallel computation. },

  journal = {Journal of Computational Physics },
  year = {1976},
  volume = {22},
  pages = {330 - 351},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {A convenient, fast, and accurate method of solving the one-dimensional
	Vlasov equation numerically in configuration space is described.
	It treats the convective terms in the x and v directions separately
	and produces a scheme of second order in Δt. The resulting free-streaming
	and accelerating equations are computed with Fourier interpolation
	and spline interpolation methods respectively. The numerical method
	is tested witth linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very
	accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution
	function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially
	increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution
	function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh.
	The methods can be generalized in a straightforward way to deal with
	more complicated cases such as problems with nonperiodic spatial
	boundary conditions, two- and three-dimensional problems with and
	without external magnetic and/or electric fields. },

  abstract = {Along with text and graphics, images are fast becoming a generic data
	type for general-purpose computer systems. This poses new problems
	for the systems designer, who must be able to preprocess digital
	image data for a wide variety of video and hard copy displays. Digital
	halftoning, the method by which the illusion of continuous-tone images
	are created through the arrangement of binary picture elements, is
	a key component of any preprocessing. Digital Halftoning addresses
	the problem of developing algorithms that best match the specific
	parameters of any target display device. It is the first significant
	study of the process of producing quality images on practical computer
	displays. To aid the systems designer, Ulichney devises the concept
	of blue noise - which has many desirable properties for halftoning
	- and suggests efficient algorithms for its use. He also introduces
	new metrics for analyzing the frequency content of periodic and aperiodic
	patterns for both rectangular and hexagonal grids, and presents a
	unique aspect ratio immunity argument in favor of hexagonal grids.
	Included are several carefully selected digitally-produced images.},
