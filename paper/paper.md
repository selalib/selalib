# Summary

The SeLaLib software library is a modular library for kinetic and
gyrokinetic simulations of plasmas in fusion energy devices by
semi-Lagrangian or particle-in-cell methods.

SeLaLib contains a collection of individual building blocks for the
parallel simulation of the Vlasov equations and the gyrokinetic equation
either based on semi-Lagrangian schemes or particle methods. Besides
numerical algorithms the library provides low-level utilities,
input-output modules as well as parallelization strategies. Moreover, a
collection of simulations for typical test cases with various
discretization schemes supplements the library.

# Statement of need

The SeLaLib project arose from the need of researchers to develop
numerical methods with simplified test cases while also having
independently tested modules that would facilitate gradual changes in
existing production code. While originally envisioned to be specialized
on the semi-lagrangian method, the abstractions that we have built can
be used with other types of approaches, such as particle-in-cell.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
