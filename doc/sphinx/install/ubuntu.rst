========================================
Install dependencies on UBUNTU or DEBIAN
========================================

The prerequisites can be installed with a couple of commands on Ubuntu. The only choice to make is between openmpi and mpich2. Most of our testing is done with openmpi but mpich should also work.

For openmpi do:

 $ sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin libhdf5-openmpi-dev

For mpich do:

 $ sudo apt-get install mpich libmpich-dev libhdf5-mpich-dev

Please make sure not to install mpich and openmpi together. When both openmpi and mpich are installed strange errors will occur and selalib will not work. If you see both installed please remove both and install one.

 $ sudo apt-get install git
