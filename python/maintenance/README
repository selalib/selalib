Maintenance tools
=================
Small collection of Python3 modules and scripts for performing ordinary and
extraordinary maintenance on the Fortran library SeLaLib.

Modules
-------
 - *maintenance_tools*: low and middle level functions and classes, used by
   scripts
 - *renaming*: (by Laura Mendoza) contains renaming function for converting a
   module name to a form that satisfies our naming conventions

Scripts
-------
 - *change_module_names*: rename all modules in the library, and make
   appropriate substitutions in the Fortran files where these are used
 - *rename_files_as_modules*: rename all source files as the modules they
   contain, and make appropriate substitutions in the CMakeLists.txt files
