sll_m_characteristics_2d_leapfrog.F90
-------------------------------------
* This file contains a module with the same name, which exposes a new type
  "leapfrog_2d_charac_computer" that extends the base class
  "sll_characteristics_2d_base" (NOTE: name should start with "sll_c_")

* Original location of file was "src/interpolation/hermite_interpolation/"

* Within "develop" branch, file is never compiled and therefore moved to
  current subdirectory "src/time_integration/characteristics/dead_code/" 

* Type "leapfrog_2d_charac_computer" seems to fully implement abstract interface

* Algorithm computes foot of characteristic using information about spatial
  derivatives of flow field U. For instance:

  dX/dt = U(X)
  dU/dt = ∂U/dt + ∂U/∂x dX/dt = ∂U/∂x U

  X(t+dt) = X(t) + dt X'(t) + dt^2/2 X"(t) + O(dt^3)

  X_np1 ~= X_n + dt*( U(X_n) + dt/2*dxU(X_n) )
