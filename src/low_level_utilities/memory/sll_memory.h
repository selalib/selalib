  ! Tentative Selalib's basic memory allocator.
  !
  ! This service is provided by two files:
  ! - sll_m_memory.h:   the present header file that exposes the allocation,
  !                   initialization and clearing macros, and
  ! - sll_m_memory.F90: which implements the error testing function and
  !                   other related functionalities.
  ! 
  ! Usage:
  ! The directive
  ! #include "sll_m_memory.h" will make available macros:
  ! SLL_ALLOCATE
  ! SLL_DEALLOCATE
  ! SLL_INIT_ARRAY
  ! SLL_CLEAR_ALLOCATE
  ! and will provide any additional functionality included in the 
  ! sll_m_memory.F90 module. This directive should be put in the 'use' section 
  ! of the subprogram that wants to use the allocator.
  !
  ! Examples: 
  !
  ! To allocate the simple array 'a' of 1000 elements:
  !
  ! SLL_ALLOCATE(a(1000),err)
  !
  ! To allocate the 2D array 'a' with non-default indexing:
  !
  ! SLL_ALLOCATE(a(5:55,1:20),err),
  !
  ! etc. The syntax comes directly from the native Fortran allocate function.
  !
  ! The deallocation macro also requires the integer error variable:
  !
  ! SLL_DEALLOCATE(a, err)
  !
  ! To initialize an array:
  !
  ! SLL_INIT_ARRAY(a,value)
  ! 
  ! To allocate and initialize an array to 0:
  !
  ! SLL_CLEAR_ALLOCATE(a(1:1000,4:500), err)
  !
  ! Any file that uses this include file will need to be compiled such that
  ! there is no upper limit to the length of a source code line. In gfortran,
  ! for instance, this behavior is obtained with the flag  
  ! -ffree-line-length-none

  ! IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR sll_m_memory.h:
  !
  ! There are only two things that we ask of the memory allocator:
  ! 1. To allocate the memory requested, and
  ! 2. In case of failure, to stop the program execution with a message 
  !    informing where was the call made.
  ! Thus, we are leaving the initialization of the memory or any other
  ! behavior, like more detailed logging, to other facilities built on top of
  ! this basic allocator. 
  !
  ! SLL_ALLOCATE has virtually the same syntax as the native Fortran 
  ! 'allocate' function, except for the mandatory integer error variable that 
  ! must be passed as an argument. The caller is responsible for providing 
  ! this variable, as with the native function.
  !
  ! The macro is kind of a wrapper around 'allocate' with error checking.
  ! It is written in a way that can be dealt with by the Fortran
  ! preprocessor. The success of the macro relies on the preprocessor 
  ! requirement that argument parentheses balance, thus, a comma within
  ! those parentheses will not end the argument. This is why a call like
  ! SLL_ALLOCATE(array(1:100,1:200),err) has two commas, but only the 
  ! second acts as an argument separator. This gives a convenient
  ! flexibility in this case.
  !
  ! Possible pitfall: Fortran has a limit on the length of a line of 132
  !                   characters. The length of some of the above macros
  !                   will exceed this limit. Any file that includes this
  !                   header will need to be compiled with a flag to 
  !                   allow for much longer lines. In gfortran the flag is:
  !                   -ffree-line-length-none
  !
  ! In case that this way of allocating memory is found not satisfactory,
  ! the file sll_m_memory.F90 has some elements of an alternative implementation,
  ! which also uses macros to handle most of the redundancies. However, these 
  ! macros, while still manageable by fpp, will also yield very long lines 
  ! that may confuse a Fortran compiler if one does not use flags like:
  ! -ffree-line-length-none
  ! The alternative implementation consists of allocating
  ! subroutines, each specialized for a particular type and dimension of an
  ! array. In order to pass along the __FILE__ and __LINE__ information to
  ! the functions conveniently, some macro call has to be made as well, unless
  ! one goes for the truly inconvenient and ugly solution of passing those
  ! manually.
