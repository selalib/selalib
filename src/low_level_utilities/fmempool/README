Plain Fortran memory pool implementation
========================================

Purpose: Allows to reuse memory (once allocated) for different datatypes, array
shapes and dimensions. Useful for dynamic domain decomposition halos.

Notes:

* The source files are taken from my project
  https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/khr/fmempool
which is released under the MIT license. The files are not modified deliberately
to be able to make updates simple.

* We decided to include this simple code into SeLaLib in order to avoid having
it as external GIT project (which had unpleasant side effects such as requiring
Internet connection at each build, etc.).
