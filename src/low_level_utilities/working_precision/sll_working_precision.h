  ! We provide a few aliases for convenience. Whenever multiple precision
  ! representations or computations are needed, these aliases provide a
  ! centralized place to define the numeric type. As their name suggests,
  ! the intent of something like sll_int64 is to guarantee a 64-bit integer,
  ! likewise for the other aliases.
  !
  ! We also provide the unqualified sll_int and sll_real which can be used
  ! anywhere, while providing a single location for changing the size of the
  ! representation library-wide.
  ! 
  ! To qualify numerical constants, like 2011_i32 we offer _i32, _i64,
  ! _f32, and _f64 for the moment.

  ! These are left without qualification and meant as the 'user' type

  ! Complex types
#define sll_comp32 complex(kind=f32)
