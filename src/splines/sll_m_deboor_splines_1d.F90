!>@brief
!> Calculates the nonvanishing B-splines and derivatives at X.
!> @details
!>   Values at X of all the relevant B-splines of order K:K+1-NDERIV
!>   are generated via sll_s_bsplvb and stored temporarily in DBIATX.
!>   Then the B-spline coefficients of the required derivatives
!>   of the B-splines of interest are generated by differencing,
!>   each from the preceding one of lower order, and combined with
!>   the values of B-splines of corresponding order in DBIATX
!>   to produce the desired values.
!
!
!> Parameters:
!> @param[in] T(LEFT+K), the knot sequence.  It is assumed that
!>   T(LEFT) < T(LEFT+1).  Also, the output is correct only if
!>   T(LEFT) <= X <= T(LEFT+1).
!> @param[in] K, the order of the B-splines to be evaluated.
!> @param[in] X, the point at which these values are sought.
!> @param[in] LEFT, indicates the left endpoint of the interval of
!>   interest.  The K B-splines whose support contains the interval
!>   ( T(LEFT), T(LEFT+1) ) are to be considered.
!
!>   DBIATX(K,NDERIV).  DBIATX(I,M) contains
!>   the value of the (M-1)st derivative of the (LEFT-K+I)-th B-spline
!>   of order K for knot sequence T, I=M,...,K, M=1,...,NDERIV.
!>   @parama[in] NDERIV, indicates that values of B-splines and their
!>   derivatives up to but not including the NDERIV-th are asked for.

!!
!!   The XT array is a set of increasing values.  The goal of the routine
!!   is to determine the largest index I so that XT(I) <= X.
!!
!!   The routine is designed to be efficient in the common situation
!!   that it is called repeatedly, with X taken from an increasing
!!   or decreasing sequence.
!!
!!   This will happen when a piecewise polynomial is to be graphed.
!!   The first guess for LEFT is therefore taken to be the value
!!   returned at the previous call and stored in the local variable ILO.
!!
!!   A first check ascertains that ILO < LXT.  This is necessary
!!   since the present call may have nothing to do with the previous
!!   call.  Then, if
!!
!!     XT(ILO) <= X < XT(ILO+1),
!!
!!   we set LEFT = ILO and are done after just three comparisons.
!!
!!   Otherwise, we repeatedly double the difference ISTEP = IHI - ILO
!!   while also moving ILO and IHI in the direction of X, until
!!
!!     XT(ILO) <= X < XT(IHI)
!!
!!   after which we use bisection to get, in addition, ILO + 1 = IHI.
!!   The value LEFT = ILO is then returned.

!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The spline is taken to be continuous from the right.
!
!    The nontrivial knot interval (T(I),T(I+1)) containing X is
!    located with the aid of sll_s_interv.  The K B-spline coefficients
!    of F relevant for this interval are then obtained from BCOEF,
!    or are taken to be zero if not explicitly available, and are
!    then differenced JDERIV times to obtain the B-spline
!    coefficients of (D**JDERIV)F relevant for that interval.
!
!    Precisely, with J = JDERIV, we have from X.(12) of the text that:
!
!      (D**J)F = sum ( BCOEF(.,J)*B(.,K-J,T) )
!
!    where
!                      / BCOEF(.),                    if J == 0
!                     /
!       BCOEF(.,J) = / BCOEF(.,J-1) - BCOEF(.-1,J-1)
!                   / -----------------------------,  if 0 < J
!                  /    (T(.+K-J) - T(.))/(K-J)
!
!    Then, we use repeatedly the fact that
!
!      sum ( A(.) * B(.,M,T)(X) ) = sum ( A(.,X) * B(.,M-1,T)(X) )
!
!    with
!                   (X - T(.))*A(.) + (T(.+M-1) - X)*A(.-1)
!      A(.,X) =   ---------------------------------------
!                   (X - T(.))      + (T(.+M-1) - X)
!
!    to write (D**J)F(X) eventually as a linear combination of
!    B-splines of order 1, and the coefficient for B(I,1,T)(X)
!    must then be the desired number (D**J)F(X).

!! sll_s_splint produces the B-spline coefficients BCOEF of an 
! interpolating spline.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The spline is of order K with knots T(1:N+K), and takes on the 
!    value GTAU(I) at TAU(I), for I = 1 to N.
!
!    The I-th equation of the linear system 
!
!      A * BCOEF = B 
!
!    for the B-spline coefficients of the interpolant enforces interpolation
!    at TAU(1:N).
!
!    Hence, B(I) = GTAU(I), for all I, and A is a band matrix with 2*K-1
!    bands, if it is invertible.
!
!    The matrix A is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by diagonal,
!    in the rows of the array Q, with the main diagonal going
!    into row K.  See comments in the program.
!
!    The banded system is then solved by a call to BANFAC, which 
!    constructs the triangular factorization for A and stores it again in
!    Q, followed by a call to BANSLV, which then obtains the solution
!    BCOEF by substitution.
!
!    BANFAC does no pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix
!    A makes this unnecessary.
!
!    The linear system to be solved is (theoretically) invertible if
!    and only if
!      T(I) < TAU(I) < TAU(I+K), for all I.
!    Violation of this condition is certain to lead to IFLAG = 2.
