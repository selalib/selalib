&geometry
 center_mesh_x1 = 0.0 ! mesh origin, fist coordinate
 center_mesh_x2 = 0.0 ! mesh origin, second coordinate
 radius =  8.0        ! mesh radius
 ! If you want to compare different space discretizations :
 ! cells_min = smallest discretization number of cells on a hex edge
 ! cells_max = largest discretization number of cells on a hex edge
 ! cells_stp = step of incrementation between cells_min and cells_max
 ! ie. cells_min = 20 cells_max = 60 cells_step = 20
 ! => 3 simulation w/ num_cells = 20, 40 and 60
 ! ie2. cells_min = cells_max (and cells_step = any number)
 ! => 1 simulation w num_cells = cells_mins = cells_max 
 cells_min = 30
 cells_max = 30
 cells_stp = 20

&test_case
  ! Different models can be done with this simulation
  ! choices are:
  !        - "CIRCULAR" (for the circular advection)
  !        - "GC" (for the guiding center model)
  model_name="GC"
/

&initial_function
  ! For the GC test-case:
  epsilon = 0.001
  ! For the Circular advection test-case:
  gauss_x1  = 2.0
  gauss_x2  = 2.0
  ! The default value for gauss_sig (the width of the gaussian pulse)
  ! is gauss_sig = 1.0/(2. * sqrt(2.)), as name list cannot sqrt, I
  ! commented this part, but you can still edit this parameter:
  !  gauss_sig = 1.0
  gauss_amp = 1.0

&interpolation
  ! The interpolation method you can choose by executing the right
  ! executable file (ie. test_2d_gc_hex_splines or test_2d_gc_hex_hermite)
  ! but here you can specify some details for the method

  ! For the spline interpolation:
  spline_degree = 2
  
  ! For the hermite interpolation:
  ! Different hermite elements have been implemented, the following notations are used
  !    Zienkiewicz with 9  degree of freedom => 9
  !    Zienkiewicz with 10 degree of freedom => 10
  !    Hsieh-Clough-Tocher (reduced)  => 11
  !    Hsieh-Clough-Tocher (complete) => 12
  !    Ganev-Dimitrov => 15
  hermite_method = 9
