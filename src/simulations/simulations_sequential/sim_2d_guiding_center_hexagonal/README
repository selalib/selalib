Description
===========
Using the SLS we solve the guiding center simulation on a hexagonal mesh
(regular quilateral triangle lattice with hexagonal shape).
Two simulations for the guiding center on a hexagonal mesh are available,
depending on the interpolation method used :

    1. Box-splines
    2. Hermite Finite Elements

They were developped in order to compare both interpolation methods.

*Remark: I have added the option to also do a circular advection simulation,
         as it is a real simple simulation that is not worth having its own directory.
	 By default the simulation will run the guiding-center simulation, if you
	 want to try the cricular advection test-case, please see namelist file.

HOWTO
=====
0. Create "run/" directory and move to it
     $ mkdir run
     $ cp sim2d_gc_hex_input.nml run/
     $ cd run


1. Run simulation(s) within directory
     $ ../test_2d_gc_hex_hermite sim2d_gc_hex_input.nml
     $ ../test_2d_gc_hex_splines sim2d_gc_hex_input.nml

   You can also run the simulation without an input file


2. Open *.xmf database with Visit (*) to visualize density over time


3. Plot diagnostics using gnuplot and *.dat files


(*) Make sure that the Xdmf plugin is installed!
