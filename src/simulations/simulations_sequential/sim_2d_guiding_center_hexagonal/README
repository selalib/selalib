Description
===========
Using the SL we solve the guiding center simulation on a hexagonal mesh
(regular quilateral triangle lattice with hexagonal shape).
Two simulations for the guiding center on a hexagonal mesh are available,
depending on the interpolation method used :

    1. Box-splines
    2. Hermite Finite Elements

They were developped in order to compare both interpolation methods.


HOWTO
=====
0. Create "run/" directory and move to it
     $ mkdir run
     $ cd run

1. Run simulation(s) within directory
     $ ../sim2d_gc_hex_hermite
     $ ../sim2d_gc_hex_splines

2. Open *.xmf database with Visit (*) to visualize density over time

3. Plot diagnostics using gnuplot and *.dat files

(*) Make sure that the Xdmf plugin is installed!
