  . L1-norm( f )
  . L2-norm( f )
  . max( f )
  . min( f )
  . Electrostatic energy
  . Kinetic energy

>> Should be computed at EACH time-step, and saved to a single HDF5 file

3D arrays
---------
  . phi (electrostatic potential)

>> Saved to file every 'output3d_interval' time-steps

4D arrays
---------
  . f (distribution function = full solution)

>> Saved to file every 'output4d_interval' time-steps
>> Each processor saves its own part of f, parallelized in x1=r
