c ... purpose
c
c     subroutine mud2sp automatically discretizes and attempts to compute
c     the second-order difference approximation to the two-dimensional
c     linear separable elliptic partial differential equation on a
c     rectangle.  the approximation is generated on a uniform grid covering
c     the rectangle (see mesh description below).  boundary conditions
c     may be specified (dirchlet), periodic, or mixed derivative in any
c     combination.  the form of the pde solved is:
c
c
c          cxx(x)*pxx + cx(x)*px + cex(x)*p(x,y) +
c
c          cyy(y)*pyy + cy(y)*py + cey(y)*p(x,y) = r(x,y)
c
c     pxx,pyy,px,py are second and first partial derivatives of the
c     unknown real solution function p(x,y) with respect to the
c     independent variables x,y.  cxx,cx,cex,cyy,cy,cey are the known
c     real coefficients of the elliptic pde and r(x,y) is the known
c     real right hand side of the equation.  cxx and cyy should be
c     positive for all x,y in the solution region.  If some of the
c     coefficients depend on both x and y then the PDE is nonseparable.
c     In this case subroutine muh2 or mud2 must be used instead of mud2sp
c     (see the files muh2.d or mud2.d)
c

c
c     mudpack5.0 software has been compiled and tested with Fortran77
c     and Fortran90 on a variety of platforms.
c                                                                               
c ... methods
c
c     details of the methods employeed by the solvers in mudpack are given
c     in [1,9].  [1,2,9] contain performance measurements on a variety of
c     elliptic pdes (see "references" in the file "readme").  in summary:
c
c *** discretization and solution (second-order solvers) (see [1])
c
c     the pde and boundary conditions are automatically discretized at all
c     grid levels using second-order finite difference formula.  diagonal
c     dominance at coarser grid levels is maintained in the presence of
c     nonzero first-order terms by adjusting the second-order coefficient
c     when necessary.  the resulting block tri-diagonal linear system is
c     approximated using multigrid iteration [10,11,13,15,16,18].  version
c     5.0 of mudpack uses only fully weighted residual restriction.  defaults
c     include cubic prolongation and w(2,1) cycles.  these can be overridden
c     with  selected multigrid options (see "mgopt").  error control based on
c     maximum relative differences is available. full multigrid cycling (fmg)
c     or cycling beginning or restarting at the finest grid level can be
c     selected. a menu of relaxation methods including gauss-seidel point,
c     line relaxation(s) (in any combination of directions) and planar
c     relaxation (for three-dimensional anisotropic problems) are provided.
c     all methods use ordering based on alternating points (red/black),
c     lines, or planes for cray vectorization and improved convergence
c     rates [14].
c
c *** higher order solution (fourth-order solvers) (see [9,19,21])
c
c     if the multigrid cycling results in a second-order estimate (i.e.,
c     discretization level error is reached) then this can be improved to a
c     fourth-order estimate using the technique of "deferred corrections."
c     the values in the solution array are used to generate a fourth-order
c     approximation to the truncation error.  second-order finite difference
c     formula are used to approximate third and fourth partial derivatives
c     of the solution function [3].  the truncation error estimate is
c     transferred down to all grid levels using weighted averaging where
c     it serves as a new right hand side.  the default multigrid options
c     are used to compute the fourth-order correction term which is added
c     to the original solution array.

c
c          an integer vector of length 17 used to pass integer
c          arguments.  iparm is set internally and defined as
c          follows:
c
c
c ... intl=iparm(1)
c
c          an initialization argument.  intl=0  must be input
c          on an initial call. in this case input arguments will
c          be checked for errors and the elliptic partial differential
c          equation and boundary conditions will be discretized using
c          second order finite difference formula.
c
c ***      An approximation is NOT generated after an intl=0 call!
c          mud2sp should be called with intl=1 to approximate the elliptic
c          PDE discretized by the intl=0 call.  intl=1 should also
c          be input if mud2sp has been called earlier and only the
c          values in in rhs (see below) or gbdy (see bndyc below)
c          or phi (see below) have changed.  This will bypass
c          redundant pde discretization and argument checking
c          and save computational time.  Some examples of when
c          intl=1 calls should be used are:
c
c          (0) after a intl=0 argument checking and discretization call
c
c          (1) mud2sp is being recalled for additional accuracy.  In
c              this case iguess=iparm(12)=1 should also be used.
c
c          (2) mud2sp is being called every time step in a time dependent
c              problem (see discussion below) where the elliptic operator
c              does not depend on time.
c
c          (3) mud2sp is being used to solve the same elliptic equation
c              for several different right hand sides (iguess=0 should
c              probably be used for each new righthand side).
c
c          intl = 0 must be input before calling with intl = 1 when any
c          of the following conditions hold:
c
c          (a) the initial call to mud2sp

c          (b) any of the integer arguments other than iguess=iparm(12)
c              or maxcy=iparm(13) or mgopt have changed since the previous
c              call.
c
c          (c) any of the floating point arguments other than tolmax=
c              fparm(5) have changed since the previous call
c
c          (d) any of the coefficients input by cofx,cofy (see below) have
c              changed since the previous call
c
c          (e) any of the constant "alfa" coefficients input by bndyc
c              (see below) have changed since the previous call.
c
c          If any of (a) through (e) are true then the elliptic PDE
c          must be discretized or rediscretized.  If none of (a)
c          through (e) holds, calls can be made with intl=1.
c          Incorrect calls with intl=1 will produce erroneous results.
c  ***     The values set in the saved work space "work" (see below) with
c          an intl=0 call must be preserved with subsequent intl=1 calls.
c
c          MUDPACK software performance should be monitored for intl=1
c          calls.  The intl=0 discretization call performance depends
c          primarily on the efficiency or lack of efficiency of the
c          user provided subroutines for pde coefficients and
c          boundary conditions.

c *** grid size arguments
c
c
c ... ixp = iparm(6)
c
c          an integer greater than one which is used in defining the number
c          of grid points in the x direction (see nx = iparm(10)).  "ixp+1"
c          is the number of points on the coarsest x grid visited during
c          multigrid cycling.  ixp should be chosen as small as possible.
c          recommended values are the small primes 2 or 3.
c          larger values can reduce multigrid convergence rates considerably,
c          especially if line relaxation in the x direction is not used.
c          if ixp > 2 then it should be 2 or a small odd value since a power
c          of 2 factor of ixp can be removed by increasing iex = iparm(8)
c          without changing nx = iparm(10).
c
c
c ... jyq = iparm(7)
c
c          an integer greater than one which is used in defining the number
c          of grid points in the y direction (see ny = iparm(11)).  "jyq+1"
c          is the number of points on the coarsest y grid visited during
c          multigrid cycling.  jyq should be chosen as small as possible.
c          recommended values are the small primes 2 or 3.
c          larger values can reduce multigrid convergence rates considerably,
c          especially if line relaxation in the y direction is not used.
c          if jyq > 2 then it should be 2 or a small odd value since a power
c          of 2 factor of jyq can be removed by increasing jey = iparm(9)
c          without changing ny = iparm(11).
c
c
c ... iex = iparm(8)
c
c          a positive integer exponent of 2 used in defining the number
c          of grid points in the x direction (see nx = iparm(10)).
c          iex .le. 50 is required.  for efficient multigrid cycling,
c          iex should be chosen as large as possible and ixp=iparm(8)
c          as small as possible within grid size constraints when
c          defining nx.
c
c
c ... jey = iparm(9)
c
c          a positive integer exponent of 2 used in defining the number
c          of grid points in the y direction (see ny = iparm(11)).
c          jey .le. 50 is required.  for efficient multigrid cycling,
c          jey should be chosen as large as possible and jyq=iparm(7)
c          as small as possible within grid size constraints when
c          defining ny.
c
c
c
c ... nx = iparm(10)
c
c          the number of equally spaced grid points in the interval [xa,xb]
c          (including the boundaries).  nx must have the form
c
c               nx = ixp*(2**(iex-1)) + 1
c
c          where ixp = iparm(6), iex = iparm(8).
c
c
c ... ny = iparm(11)
c
c          the number of equally spaced grid points in the interval [yc,yd]
c          (including the boundaries).  ny must have the form:
c
c               ny = jyq*(2**(jey-1)) + 1
c
c          where jyq = iparm(7), jey = iparm(9).
c
c
c *** example
c
c         suppose a solution is wanted on a 33 by 97 grid.  then
c         ixp=2, jyq=6 and iex=jey=5 could be used.  a better
c         choice would be ixp=2, jyq=3, and iex=5, jey=6.
c
c
c *** note
c
c     let G be the nx by ny fine grid on which the approximation is
c     generated and let n = max0(iex,jey).  in mudpack, multigrid
c     cycling is implemented on the ascending chain of grids
c
c         G(1) < ... < G(k) < ... < G(n) = G.
c
c     each G(k) (k=1,...,n) has mx(k) by my(k) grid points
c     given by:
c
c         mx(k) = ixp*[2**(max0(iex+k-n,1)-1)] + 1
c
c         my(k) = jyq*[2**(max0(jey+k-n,1)-1)] + 1
c
c
c
c ... iguess=iparm(12)
c
c          = 0 if no initial guess to the pde is provided
c
c          = 1 if an initial guess to the pde is at the finest grid
c              level is provided in phi (see below)
c
c     comments on iguess = 0 or 1 . . .
c
c     even if iguess = 0, phi must be initialized at all grid points (this
c     is not checked).  phi can be set to 0.0 at non-dirchlet grid points
c     if nothing better is available.  the values set in phi when iguess = 0
c     are passed down and serve as an initial guess to the pde at the coarsest
c     grid level where cycling commences.  in this sense, values input in
c     phi always serve as an initial guess.  setting iguess = 0 forces full
c     multigrid cycling beginning at the coarsest and finishing at the finest
c     grid level.
c
c     if iguess = 1 then the values input in phi are an initial guess to the
c     pde at the finest grid level where cycling begins.  this option should
c     be used only if a "very good" initial guess is available (as, for
c     example, when restarting from a previous iguess=0 call).
c
c     time dependent problems . . .
c
c *** assume we are solving an elliptic pde every time step in a
c     marching problem of the form:
c
c          l(p(t)) = r(t)
c
c     where the differential operator "l" has no time dependence,
c     "p(t)" is the solution and "r(t)" is the right hand side at
c     current time "t". let "dt" be the increment between time steps.
c     then p(t) can be used as an initial guess to p(t+dt) with
c     intl = 1 when solving
c
c          l(p(t+dt)) = r(t+dt).
c
c     after the first two time steps, rather than continue, it would
c     be better to define the "correction" term:
c
c          e(t,dt) = p(t+dt) - p(t)
c
c     this clearly satisfies the equation
c
c          l(e(t,dt)) = r(t+dt) - r(t).
c
c     this should be solved with iguess = 0 and intl = 1. boundary
c     conditions for e(t,dt) are obtained from the boundary conditions
c     for p(t) by subtracting given values at t from given values at
c     t+dt. for example if
c
c          d(p(t))/dx = f(t), d(p(t+dt))/dx = f(t+dt)
c
c     at some x boundary then e(t,dt) satisfies the derivative
c     boundary condition
c
c          d(e(t,dt))/dx = f(t+dt) - f(t).
c
c     e(t,dt) can be preset to 0.0 (at nondirchlet points) or (if p(t-dt)
c     is saved) to p(t)-p(t-dt).  with iguess = 0, these values will serve
c     as an initial guess to e(t,dt) at the coarsest grid level.  this
c     approach has the advantage that a full sequence of multigrid cycles,
c     beginning at the coarsest grid level, is invoked every time step in
c     solving for e(t,dt).  a few digits of accuracy in e(t,dt), which is
c     ordinarily much smaller than p(t), will yield several more digits of
c     accuracy in the final approximation:
c
c          p(t+dt) = p(t) + e(t,dt).
c
c     using this approach to integrate in time will give more accuracy
c     then using p(t) as an initial guess to p(t+dt) for all time steps.
c     it does require additional storage.
c
c     if the differential operator "l" has time dependence (either thru
c     the coefficients in the pde or the coefficients in the derivative
c     boundary conditions) then use p(t) as an initial guess to p(t+dt)
c     when solving
c
c          l(t+dt)(p(t+dt)) = r(t+dt)
c
c     with intl = 0 for all time steps (the discretization must be repeated
c     for each new "t"). either iguess = 0 (p(t) will then be an initial
c     guess at the coarsest grid level where cycles will commence) or
c     iguess = 1 (p(t) will then be an initial guess at the finest grid
c     level where cycles will remain fixed) can be tried.

c          tolmax=fparm(5)=0.0 (no error control).  when tolmax > 0.0
c          is input (error control) then maxcy is a limit on the number
c          of cycles between the finest and coarsest grid levels.  in
c          any case, at most maxcy*(iprer+ipost) relaxation sweeps are
c          are performed at the finest grid level (see iprer=mgopt(2),

c          required.  this will usually be less than that given by the
c          simplified formula for length=iparm(15) (see as input argument)
c
c
c ... iparm(17)  *** set for intl=1 calls only
c
c          on output iparm(17) contains the actual number of multigrid cycles
c          between the finest and coarsest grid levels used to obtain the
c          approximation when error control (tolmax > 0.0) is set.
c
c
c ... fparm(6)   *** set for intl=1 calls with fparm(5) > 0. only
c
c          on output fparm(6) contains the final computed maximum relative
c          difference between the last two iterates at the finest grid level.
c          fparm(6) is computed only if there is error control (tolmax > 0.0)
c          assume phi1(i,j,k) and phi2(i,j,k) are the last two computed
c          values for phi(i,j,k) at all points of the finest grid level.
c          if we define
c
c               phdif = max(abs(phi2(i,j)-phi1(i,j))) over all i,j
c
c          and
c
c               phmax = max(abs(phi2(i,j)) over all i,j
c
c          then
c
c               fparm(6) = phdif/phmax
c
c          is returned whenever phmax > 0.0. in the degenerate case
c          phmax = 0.0, fparm(6) = phdif is returned.
c
c
c ... work
c
c          on output work contains intermediate values that must not
c          be destroyed if mud2sp is to be called again with intl=1
c
c
c ... phi   *** for intl=1 calls only
c
c          on output phi(i,j) contains the approximation to p(xi,yj)
c          for all mesh points i = 1,...,nx and j=1,...,ny.  the last
c          computed iterate in phi is returned even if convergence is
c          not obtained
c
c
c ... ierror
c
c          For intl=iparm(1)=0 initialization calls, ierror is an
c          error flag that indicates invalid input arguments when
c          returned positive and nonfatal warnings when returned
c          negative.  Argument checking and discretization
c          is bypassed for intl=1 calls which can only return
c          ierror = -1 or 0 or 1.
c
c
c     non-fatal warnings * * *
c
c
c     =-5 if kcycle=mgopt(1) is greater than 2. values larger than 2 results
c         in an algorithm which probably does far more computation than
c         necessary.  kcycle = 1 (v cycles)  or kcycle=2 (w cycles) should
c         suffice for most problems.  ierror = -5 is also set if either
c         iprer = mgopt(2) or ipost=mgopt(3) is greater than 2.  the
c         ierror=-5 flag is overridden by any other fatal or non-fatal
c         error.
c
c     =-4 if there are dominant nonzero first order terms in the pde which
c         make it "hyperbolic" at the finest grid level. numerically, this
c         happens if:
c
c              abs(cx)*dlx > 2.*abs(cxx)   (dlx = (xb-xa)/(nx-1))
c
c                         (or)
c
c              abs(cy)*dly > 2.*abs(cyy)   (dly = (yd-yc)/(ny-1))
c
c
c         at some fine grid point (xi,yj).  if an adjustment is not made the
c         condition can lead to a matrix coming from the discretization
c         which is not diagonally dominant and divergence is possible. since
c         the condition is "likely" at coarser grid levels for pde's with
c         nonzero first order terms, the adjustments (actually first order
c         approximations to the pde)
c
c
c             cxx = amax1(cxx,0.5*abs(cx)*dx)
c
c                          (and)
c
c             cyy = amax1(cyy,0.5*abs(cy)*dy)
c
c
c         (here dx,dy are the x,y mesh sizes of the subgrid)
c
c         are made to preserve convergence of multigrid iteration. if made
c         at the finest grid level, it can lead to convergence to an
c         erroneous solution (flagged by ierror = -4).  a possible remedy
c         is to increase resolution. the ierror = -4 flag overrides the
c         nonfatal ierror = -5 flag.
c
c
c     =-3  if the continuous elliptic pde is singular.  this means the
c          boundary conditions are periodic or pure derivative at all
c          boundaries and ce(x,y) = 0.0 for all x,y.  a solution is still
c          attempted but convergence may not occur due to ill-conditioning
c          of the linear system coming from the discretization.  the
c          ierror = -3 flag overrides the ierror=-4 and ierror=-5 nonfatal
c          flags.
c
c
c     =-2  if the pde is not elliptic (i.e., cxx*cyy.le.0.0 for some (xi,yj))
c          in this case a solution is still attempted although convergence
c          may not occur due to ill-conditioning of the linear system.
c          the ierror = -2 flag overrides the ierror=-5,-4,-3 nonfatal
c          flags.
c
c
c     =-1  if convergence to the tolerance specified in tolmax=fparm(5)>0.
c          is not obtained in maxcy=iparm(13) multigrid cycles between the
c          coarsest (ixp+1,jyq+1) and finest (nx,ny) grid levels.
c          in this case the last computed iterate is still returned.
c          the ierror = -1 flag overrides all other nonfatal flags
