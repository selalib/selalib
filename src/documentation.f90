!> The documentation of Selalib will exist in two different forms,
!> each intended for a possibly different audience. We have a "Selalib
!> Guide" website, which contains a listing of all the
!> library modules with a description of their interface. Ideally, a
!> user should interact with a module only through the specified
!> interface, which, if we have been successful, should permit the
!> user to complete the desired task in a reasonably simple way.
!>
!> A second form of documentation will be through an automatic system
!> (we have chosen Doxygen). Here the user or developer should find
!> descriptions of the available methods on our website. Preferrably,
!> only routines which are meant to be exposed to the users should be
!> documented this way. The last form of documentation is targeted at
!> the library developers: source code comments. We aim here at
!> documenting design choices, particular implementation decisions and
!> above all, the intent of the programmer. The idea is to make the
!> code as accessible to the reader as possible. Whenever code may
!> appear to be not sufficiently clear even after the use of descriptive
!> names and code organization, then the comments may be the only way
!> to aid the reader in navigating the source code. All these documents
!> will be made public upon the library release.
