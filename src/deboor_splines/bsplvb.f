c        (j+1)*(index-1))  of the b-splines whose values at  x  are to
c        be returned.  index  is used to avoid recalculations when seve-
c        ral columns of the triangular array of b-spline values are nee-
c        ded (e.g., in  bsplpp  or in  bsplvd ). precisely,
c                     if  index = 1 ,
c        the calculation starts from scratch and the entire triangular
c        array of b-spline values of orders 1,2,...,jhigh  is generated
c        order by order , i.e., column by column .
c                     if  index = 2 ,
c        only the b-spline values of order  j+1, j+2, ..., jout  are ge-
c        nerated, the assumption being that  biatx , j , deltal , deltar
c        are, on entry, as they were on exit at the previous call.
c           in particular, if  jhigh = 0, then  jout = j+1, i.e., just
c        the next column of b-spline values is generated.
