calls bsplvb, banfac/slv
c
c   splint  produces the b-spline coeff.s  bcoef  of the spline of order
c   k  with knots  t(i), i=1,..., n + k , which takes on the value
c   gtau(i) at  tau(i), i=1,..., n .
c
c******  i n p u t  ******
c  tau.....array of length  n , containing data point abscissae.
c    a s s u m p t i o n . . .  tau  is strictly increasing
c  gtau.....corresponding array of length  n , containing data point or-
c        dinates
c  t.....knot sequence, of length  n+k
c  n.....number of data points and dimension of spline space  s(k,t)
c  k.....order of spline
c
c******  o u t p u t  ******
c  q.....array of size  (2*k-1)*n , containing the triangular factoriz-
c        ation of the coefficient matrix of the linear system for the b-
c        coefficients of the spline interpolant.
c           the b-coeffs for the interpolant of an additional data set
c        (tau(i),htau(i)), i=1,...,n  with the same data abscissae can
c        be obtained without going through all the calculations in this
c        routine, simply by loading  htau  into  bcoef  and then execut-
c        ing the    call banslv ( q, 2*k-1, n, k-1, k-1, bcoef )
c  bcoef.....the b-coefficients of the interpolant, of length  n
c  iflag.....an integer indicating success (= 1)  or failure (= 2)
c        the linear system to be solved is (theoretically) invertible if
c        and only if
c              t(i) .lt. tau(i) .lt. t(i+k),    all i.
c        violation of this condition is certain to lead to  iflag = 2 .
c
c******  m e t h o d  ******
c     the i-th equation of the linear system  a*bcoef = b  for the b-co-
c  effs of the interpolant enforces interpolation at  tau(i), i=1,...,n.
c  hence,  b(i) = gtau(i), all i, and  a  is a band matrix with  2k-1
c   bands (if it is invertible).
c     the matrix  a  is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by di-
c  agonal, in the  r o w s  of the array  q , with the main diagonal go-
c  ing into row  k .  see comments in the program below.
c     the banded system is then solved by a call to  banfac (which con-
c  structs the triangular factorization for  a  and stores it again in
c   q ), followed by a call to  banslv (which then obtains the solution
c   bcoef  by substitution).
c     banfac  does no pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix
c  a  makes this unnecessary.

      integer iflag,k,n,   i,ilp1mx,j,jj,km1,kpkm2,left,lenq,np1

c     dimension q(2*k-1,n), t(n+k)
current fortran standard makes it impossible to specify precisely the
c  dimension of  q  and  t  without the introduction of otherwise super-
c  fluous additional arguments.
      np1 = n + 1
      km1 = k - 1
      kpkm2 = 2*km1
      left = k
c                zero out all entries of q
      lenq = n*(k+km1)

         left = left - 1
         if (taui .gt. t(left+1))       go to 998
c        *** the i-th equation enforces interpolation at taui, hence
c        a(i,j) = b(j,k,t)(taui), all j. only the  k  entries with  j =
c        left-k+1,...,left actually might be nonzero. these  k  numbers
c        are returned, in  bcoef (used for temp.storage here), by the
c        following
   16    call bsplvb ( t, k, 1, taui, left, bcoef )
c        we therefore want  bcoef(j) = b(left-k+j)(taui) to go into
c        a(i,left-k+j), i.e., into  q(i-(left+j)+2*k,(left+j)-k) since
c        a(i+j,j)  is to go into  q(i+k,j), all i,j,  if we consider  q
c        as a two-dim. array , with  2*k-1  rows (see comments in
c        banfac). in the present program, we treat  q  as an equivalent
c        one-dimensional array (because of fortran restrictions on
c        dimension statements) . we therefore want  bcoef(j) to go into
c        entry
c            i -(left+j) + 2*k + ((left+j) - k-1)*(2*k-1)
c                   =  i-left+1 + (left -k)*(2*k-1) + (2*k-2)*j
