! The connectivities array in this file is an array of dimensions 
! number_patches X 8. The i-th row contains the connectivity information for 
! the i-th face. The connectivity of each face is described by a pair. The 
! first value is the other patch and the second is the connecting face in 
! such patch. The reader of this function should properly dimension the 
! receiving array and transpose, given the column-major convention used by 
! Fortran.
