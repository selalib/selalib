skyline.f
---------
This file contains a program (by Nhung Pham and Philippe Helluy) which solves
the linear system Ax=b, where A is given as a standard Fortran 2D array.
First, A is stored in a skyline structure, and then the system is solved by
using a specialized function "sol" (contained in file "sol.f").
By doing this, computation time is saved.
Nhung Pham does not know who still needs this file, and she thinks it can be
removed.
