Developer's note:

The files:
ID.txt
IEN_0.txt
IEN_1.txt
IEN_2.txt
IEN_3.txt
LM_0.txt
LM_1.txt
LM_2.txt
LM_3.txt
square_4patchs_n4_info.txt
square_4patchs_n4_patch0.txt
square_4patchs_n4_patch1.txt
square_4patchs_n4_patch2.txt
square_4patchs_n4_patch3.txt

constitute a single data-set generated by CAID for the purposes of testing. It is desirable to have the files ID, IEN, LM with names that are also related with the name of the patches, but for the moment this is not the case.
