    !
    !  Input Parameters
    !    z            -  location where approximations are to be
    !                    accurate,
    !    x(0:nd)      -  grid point locations, found in x(0:n)
    !    nd           -  dimension of x- and c-arrays in calling
    !                    program x(0:nd) and c(0:nd,0:m), respectively,
    !    m            -  highest derivative for which weights are
    !                    sought,
    !
    !  Output Parameter
    !    c(0:nd,0:m)  -  weights at grid locations x(0:n) for
