!> @details
  !! In this directory we are implementing an abstract class of particle method and two classes which
  !! extend it:
  !! - one is a "simple" PIC method based on the one implemented by Sever and Edwin, but with no optimization
  !! - the other one is a remapped PIC method which follows from the BSL and LTPIC approach
  !! These classes (and the corresponding deposition and remapping schemes) are used in a simulation
  !! implemented in the module sll_m_sim_4d_vp_generic_pic_cartesian

! this is directory [[selalib:src/particle_methods]]
