! Why this with macros? We explore hiding the access to an array behind a
! defined interface but at the same time we don't want to be penalized by
! function calls. Access functions like these are expected to live within
! inner loops and thus would have an appreciable overhead.

! NOTE: if the DEBUG flag is not set, the assertions get expanded into nothing.
! For this reason, the semicolon has to be part of the macro expansion. If
! not, we would end up in this case with dangling semicolons, yielding
! compilation errors. This means that there are situations in which we want
! the semicolons to be part of the macro and others in which they are not.
! So much for consistency...
!
! At the same time, SLL_ASSERT is an exceptional case in which it is the only
! macro that is meant to expand into nothing. All other macros could be 
! written without the semicolons in their definition, thus maintaining some
! resemblance of uniformity in the syntax.
