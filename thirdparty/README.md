# Third party simulations

Here are some codes that using selalib.
This directory is dedicated to code used for publications
Theses codes are experimental and are not fully documented.
Requirements of the simulations that are
present in the developer guide are not
mandatory here. They are in the repository to keep the link with selalib
and follow every updates. The build is disabled by default and can be toggle
by setting BUILD_THIRDPARTY to ON
