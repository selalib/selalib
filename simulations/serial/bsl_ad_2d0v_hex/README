Description
===========
Using the SL scheme we solve the advection simulation on a hexagonal mesh
(regular equilateral triangle lattice with hexagonal shape).
Two simulations for the advection on a hexagonal mesh are available:

    1. Constant advection
    2. Circular advection

HOWTO
=====
0. Compile the SeLaLib library: Run the following command in the
   build directory of the librairy
     $ make install
   Follow the path were the simulation was written.

1. Create "run/" directory and move to it
     $ mkdir run
     $ cp sim2d_hex.nml run/
     $ cd run
     ( Optional: change the input file to your liking )

2. Run simulation(s) within directory
     $ ../sim_bsl_ad_2d0v_hex sim2d_hex.nml

   You can also run the simulation without an input file


3. Open *.xmf database with Visit (*) to visualize density over time


3. Plot diagnostics using gnuplot and *.dat files


(*) Make sure that the Xdmf plugin is installed!
