subroutine bsplvb ( t, jhigh, index, x, left, biatx )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! BSPLVB evaluates B-splines at a point X with a given knot sequence.
!
!  Discusion:
!
!    BSPLVB evaluates all possibly nonzero B-splines at X of order
!
!      JOUT = MAX ( JHIGH, (J+1)*(INDEX-1) )
!
!    with knot sequence T.
!
!    The recurrence relation
!
!                     X - T(I)               T(I+J+1) - X
!    B(I,J+1)(X) = ----------- * B(I,J)(X) + --------------- * B(I+1,J)(X)
!                  T(I+J)-T(I)               T(I+J+1)-T(I+1)
!
!    is used to generate B(LEFT-J:LEFT,J+1)(X) from B(LEFT-J+1:LEFT,J)(X)
!    storing the new values in BIATX over the old.
!
!    The facts that
!
!      B(I,1)(X) = 1  if  T(I) <= X < T(I+1)
!
!    and that
!
!      B(I,J)(X) = 0  unless  T(I) <= X < T(I+J)
!
!    are used.
!
!    The particular organization of the calculations follows
!    algorithm 8 in chapter X of the text.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) T(LEFT+JOUT), the knot sequence.  T is assumed to
!    be nondecreasing, and also, T(LEFT) must be strictly less than
!    T(LEFT+1).
!
!    Input, integer JHIGH, INDEX, determine the order
!    JOUT = max ( JHIGH, (J+1)*(INDEX-1) )
!    of the B-splines whose values at X are to be returned.
!    INDEX is used to avoid recalculations when several
!    columns of the triangular array of B-spline values are
!    needed, for example, in BVALUE or in BSPLVD.
!    If INDEX = 1, the calculation starts from scratch and the entire
!    triangular array of B-spline values of orders
!    1, 2, ...,JHIGH is generated order by order, that is,
!    column by column.
!    If INDEX = 2, only the B-spline values of order J+1, J+2, ..., JOUT
!    are generated, the assumption being that BIATX, J,
!    DELTAL, DELTAR are, on entry, as they were on exit
!    at the previous call.  In particular, if JHIGH = 0,
!    then JOUT = J+1, that is, just the next column of B-spline
!    values is generated.
!    Warning: the restriction  JOUT <= JMAX (= 20) is
!    imposed arbitrarily by the dimension statement for DELTAL
!    and DELTAR, but is nowhere checked for.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X, the point at which the B-splines
!    are to be evaluated.
!
!    Input, integer LEFT, an integer chosen so that
!    T(LEFT) <= X <= T(LEFT+1).
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) BIATX(JOUT), with BIATX(I) containing the
!    value at X of the polynomial of order JOUT which agrees
!    with the B-spline B(LEFT-JOUT+I,JOUT,T) on the interval
!    (T(LEFT),T(LEFT+1)).
