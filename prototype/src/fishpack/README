SCD released version 1.1 of FISHPACK90 on December 19, 2005. It is an
improvement over Version 1.0 in that it uses Fortran90 intrinsic function
ASSOCIATED to check on pointer association. Also, version 1.1 offers
an integated Makefile for use with gmake.

Here is some history for version 1.0:

SCD released FISHPACK90 1.0 in September 30 2004. It is an improvement
of the original Fortran77 FISHPACK insofar as it has removed workspace
arguments in the solvers, replacing them with FORTRAN90 derived data
types that are pointers to real and complex allocatable arrays and are
opaque to user level interface. And also this version replaced many 
internal interfaces in conformance with strict prototype
matching of Fortran90.

Neither version FISHPACK90 1.0 nor 1.1 are full-blown Fortran90 
implementation of FISHPACK. User calls to the old FISHPACK solvers are 
not compatible with calls to FISHPACK90 solvers.

IMPORTANT NOTE: FISHPACK90 has dependencies in the FFTPACK library; the
present version of  FFTPACK has not been updated in the same manner as
FISHPACK90. That is, FFTPACK may not strictly conform to the Fortran90
interface specification.
