C
C                        W
c                          A fortran 90 derived TYPE (fishworkspace) variable
c                          that must be declared by the user.  The first
c                          two declarative statements in the user program
c                          calling HSTCSP must be:
c
c                               USE fish
c                               TYPE (fishworkspace) :: W
c
c                          The first statement makes the fishpack module
c                          defined in the file "fish.f" available to the
c                          user program calling HSTCSP.  The second statement
c                          declares a derived type variable (defined in
c                          the module "fish.f") which is used internally
c                          in BLKTRI to dynamically allocate real and complex
c                          work space used in solution.  An error flag
c                          (IERROR = 20) is set if the required work space
c                          allocation fails (for example if N,M are too large)
c                          Real and complex values are set in the components
c                          of W on a initial (IFLG=0) call to HSTCSP.  These
c                          must be preserved on non-initial calls (INTL=1)
c                          to HSTCSP.  This eliminates redundant calculations
c                          and saves compute time.
c               ****       IMPORTANT!  The user program calling HSTCSP should
c                          include the statement:
c
c                               CALL FISHFIN(W)
C
C                          after the final approximation is generated by
C                          HSTCSP.  The will deallocate the real and complex
c                          work space of W.  Failure to include this statement
c                          could result in serious memory leakage.
C
C

C
C                        PERTRB
C                          IF A COMBINATION OF PERIODIC, DERIVATIVE,
C                          OR UNSPECIFIED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IS
C                          SPECIFIED FOR A POISSON EQUATION

C                          PERTRB IS A CONSTANT, CALCULATED AND
C                          SUBTRACTED FROM F, WHICH ENSURES THAT A
C                          SOLUTION EXISTS.  HSTCSP THEN COMPUTES THIS
C                          SOLUTION, WHICH IS A LEAST SQUARES SOLUTION
C                          TO THE ORIGINAL APPROXIMATION.
C                          THIS SOLUTION PLUS ANY CONSTANT IS ALSO
C                          A SOLUTION; HENCE, THE SOLUTION IS NOT
C                          UNIQUE.  THE VALUE OF PERTRB SHOULD BE
C                          SMALL COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE F.
C                          OTHERWISE, A SOLUTION IS OBTAINED TO AN
C                          ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
C                          THIS COMPARISON SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE TO
C                          INSURE THAT A MEANINGFUL SOLUTION HAS BEEN
