#HACK: THIS SHOULD BE MADE BETTER AND AT A LOWER LEVEL. Problem: when hdf5 is
# present and is parallel, we need to use the MPI compiler wrapper and this
# should propagate to all its clients, even if these were envisioned as
# sequential modules. Or, maybe this should be handled at the highest possible
# level: once the parallel hdf5 is found, all the library should be compiled 
# with the mpi wrapper compiler.
