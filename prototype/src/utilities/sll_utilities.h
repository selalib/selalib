! BYTE_SIZEOF() uses the byte_size, which is defined in sll_utilities.F90. This
! macro returns the size of 'var' measured in bytes.
! INT32_SIZEOF() uses i32, which is defined in the basic numeric types:
! sll_working_precision.F90. The use of the integer as a yardstick is a
! more natural choice in some contexts.

#define BYTE_SIZEOF( var )  size(transfer(var, (/1_byte_size/) ))
#define INT32_SIZEOF( var ) size(transfer(var, (/1_i32/)))
