!> \section Description Description
!>
!> This is a draft for a guide to the facilities offered by Selalib, the Semi-Lagrangian Library. It serves as a record for module descriptions, design decision, pending issues, etc., which are relevant for the development and improvement of the library. The main focus is the exposed API, thus the document also serves as a working document for the architectural specifications. More specific implementation details should be found in the comments within the source code. We may decide later to extract those either with an automatic system or in a developer's manual. At the time of writing this version of the draft, the library contains only a few modules in the lower levels and aims at having a minimalist structure. Of those capabilities that could be deemed interesting enough by the managers of GYSELA, the intent would be to incorporate them that code. In this sense, this library prototype can also be a testbed for ideas and suggestions that could eventually be absorbed into production code.
