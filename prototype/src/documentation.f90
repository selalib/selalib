!> \section Description Description
!>
!> The documentation of Selalib will exist in three different forms, each intended for a possibly different audience. We have a "Selalib Manual" document (pdf format), which contains a listing of all the library modules with a description of their intarface. Ideally, a user should interact with a module only through the specified interface, which, if we have been successful, should permit the user to complete the desired task in a reasonably simple way. A second form of documentation will be through an automatic system (we have chosen Doxygen). Here the user or developer should find descriptions of the available methods on our website. Preferrably, only routines which are meant to be exposed to the users should be documented this way. The last form of documentation is targeted at the library developers: source code comments. We aim here at documenting design choices, particular implementation decisions and above all, the intent of the programmer. The idea is to make the code as accessible to the reader as possible. Whenever code may appear to be not sufficiently clear even after the use of descriptive names and code organization, then the comments may be the only way to aid the reader in navigating the source code. All these documents will be made public upon the library release.
