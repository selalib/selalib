!! SPLI2D produces a interpolatory tensor product spline.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    SPLI2D is an extended version of SPLINT.
!
!    SPLI2D produces the B-spline coefficients BCOEF(J,.) of the
!    spline of order K with knots T(1:N+K), which takes on
!    the value GTAU(I,J) at TAU(I), I=1,..., N, J=1,...,M.
!
!    The I-th equation of the linear system
!
!      A * BCOEF = B
!
!    for the B-spline coefficients of the interpolant enforces
!    interpolation at TAU(I), I=1,...,N.  Hence,  B(I) = GTAU(I),
!    for all I, and A is a band matrix with 2*K-1 bands, if it is
!    invertible.
!
!    The matrix A is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by
!    diagonal, in the rows of the array Q, with the main diagonal
!    going into row K.
!
!    The banded system is then solved by a call to BANFAC, which
!    constructs the triangular factorization for A and stores it
!    again in Q, followed by a call to BANSLV, which then obtains
!    the solution BCOEF by substitution.
!
!     The linear system to be solved is theoretically invertible if
!     and only if
!
!       T(I) < TAU(I) < TAU(I+K), for all I.
!
!     Violation of this condition is certain to lead to IFLAG = 2.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) TAU(N), contains the data point abscissas.
!    TAU must be strictly increasing
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) GTAU(N,M), contains the data point ordinates.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) T(N+K), the knot sequence.
!
!    Input, integer N, the number of data points and the
!    dimension of the spline space SPLINE(K,T)
!
!    Input, integer K, the order of the spline.
!
!    Input, integer M, the number of data sets.
!
!    Work space, real ( kind = 8 ) WORK(N).
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) Q(2*K-1)*N, the triangular
!    factorization of the coefficient matrix of the linear
!    system for the B-spline coefficients of the spline interpolant.
!    The B-spline coefficients for the interpolant of an additional
!    data set ( TAU(I), HTAU(I) ), I=1,...,N  with the same data
!    abscissae can be obtained without going through all the
!    calculations in this routine, simply by loading HTAU into
!    BCOEF and then using the statement
!      CALL BANSLV ( Q, 2*K-1, N, K-1, K-1, BCOEF )
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) BCOEF(N), the B-spline coefficients of
!    the interpolant.
!
!    Output, integer IFLAG, error indicator.
!    1, no error.
!    2, an error occurred, which may have been caused by
!       singularity of the linear system.
