c     subroutine resm3cr(nx,ny,nz,icros,work,res)
c
c
c ... purpose
c
c
c     subroutine resm3cr computes the fine grid residual in the nx by ny by nz
c     array res after calling mud3cr.  if
c
c          L * p = f
c
c     is the n by n (n = nx*ny*nz) block tri-diagonal linear system resulting
c     from the pde discretization (done internally in mud3cr) and phi
c     is the approximation to p obtained by calling mud3cr, then resm3cr computes
c     the nx by ny by nz residual array
c
c          res = f - L * phi.
c
c     one of the vector norms of res,
c
c          || res ||
c
c     can be computed as a "measure" of how well phi satisfies the
c     discretization equations.  for example, the following statements
c     will compute the location and size of the maximum residual in res
c     on cray computers:
c
c          ijk = isamax(nx*ny*nz,res,1)
c
c          kmax = (ijk-1)/(nx*ny) + 1
c
c          jmax = (ijk-(kmax-1)*nx*ny-1)/nx + 1
c
c          imax = ij - nx*((kmax-1)*ny-jmax+1)
c
c          resmax = abs(res(imax,jmax,kmax))
c
c
c *** please note:
c
c          let pe be the exact continuous solution to the elliptic pde
c          evaluated on the nx by ny by nz discretization grid
c
c          let p be the exact solution to the linear discretization
c
c          let phi be the approximation to p generated by the mudpack solver
c
c     then discretization level error is defined by the condition
c
c          || phi - p || < || p - pe ||.
c                        =
c
c     a common measure of multigrid efficieny is that discretization level
c     error is reached in one full multigrid cycle (see references [2,9] in
c     the mudpack file "readme").  this can happen before the residual is
c     reduced to the level of roundoff error.  consequently, || res || is
c     a conservative measure of accuracy which can be wasteful if multi-
c     grid cycles are executed until it reaches the level of roundoff error.
c
c     || res || can be used to estimate the convergence rate of multigrid
c     iteration.  let r(n) be the residual and e(n) be the error after
c     executing n cycles.  they are related by the residual equation
c
c          L * e(n) = r(n).
c
c     it follows that the ratio
c
c          || r(n+1) || / || r(n) ||
c
c     estimates
c
c          || e(n+1) || / || e(n) ||
c
c     which in turn estimates the convergence rate
c
c          c = max || e(k+1) || / || e(k) ||.
c               k
c
c     notice
c                         n
c          || e(n) || <  c  || e(0) ||.

c ... assumptions (see mud3.d or mud3sa.d)
c
c     (1) nx,ny,nz have the same values as iparm(14),iparm(15),iparm(16)
c         (used to set the fine grid resolution when calling mud3cr
c
c     (2) icros,work,phi are the same arguments used in calling mud3cr
c
c     (3) icros,work,phi have not changed since the last call to mud3cr
c
c     (3) assures a copy of the last approximation phi and the discretization
c     coefficients are contained in work.  If these assumptions are not
c     true then resm3cr cannot compute the residual in res.
